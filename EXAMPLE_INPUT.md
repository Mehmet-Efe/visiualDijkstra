# visiualDijkstra
Visualized dijkstra algorithm with java graphics

Example inputs

Node count : Integer input

Example : 5
    
Adjacency node and weight : "-" should be used to add as many neighborhoods as desired.
Commas should be used to separate the starting node, the ending node, and the weight.

Example : 0,2,1-2,1,5

first part -> 0 and 2 is Adjacency and weight is 1

second part -> 2 and 1 is Adjacency and weight is 5
      
Source node : Integer input for source node for all shortest path
example : 2
